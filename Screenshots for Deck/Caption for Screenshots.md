The SoilGrid API takes inputs as lat/lon pairs. While the database covers almost all of the world, while running the API for the first time, it became evident that not every coordinate input would provide actual results. The selected code was added to the call loop and would activate if the result for a particular location was null. The while loop changes the input lat/long by a random amount of up to no more than approx 1850 feet in either direct on both axes, updates the coordinates in the DataFrame and attempts the API call again, attempting to receive non-null value. If the resultant values returned null, the while loop would repeat, but add 10% to the random distance each iteration.
